    <div class="subtitle">Problem & Interview (10 people)</div>
    <div>
        <p id="comfort">Student organization can be a good place for students to build social relationships and learn new things. However, it sometimes is hard for new students to find information about student organizations and events. After interviewing 10 students in Parsons School of Design, I found out that there are several problems: </p>
        <p id="comfort">· Many students who have studied for one or two years do not know much about school's student organization website. </p>
        <p id="comfort">· Most of students use facebook pages or paper posters to get information when they were new students. </p>
        <p id="comfort">· Some student organizations have their own websites to post events and news, which are hard for new students to find. </p>

    <img style="width: 100%; height: 100%; " src="img/stuorg/comparison.jpg">
        <p id="comfort">By interviewing students and comparing school's website with facebook, I found that students have the following needs when they were searching for information of student organizations: </p>
        <p id="comfort">· New students need reviews about organizations and previous events to provide more information from old students who have attended the events before and help them decide if they want to join or not. </p>
        <p id="comfort">· They want more recommendations so that they do not have to search for all the organizations and events. </p>
        <p id="comfort">· They want a place to show all the events they want to attend to better arrange their time. </p>
        <p id="comfort">· Social function is important: new students need to have a way to talk to old students and make friends. </p>
        <p id="comfort">· Students especially new students need a place to see all student organizations in one place and see new and previous events to compare and decide if they are interested in the organizations or events. </p>
