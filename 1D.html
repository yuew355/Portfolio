    <p id="comfort">The idea came from a book called Convenience Store Woman, which talks about a woman who could not have the same feelings of most of people worked in a convenience store for eighteen years and was considered strange and abnormal by people around her. The story is about how people around her behave and how she reacts and tries to become normal and be accepted by the normal society. </p>
    <p id="comfort">The story makes me think about the environment and impact of people. Cities and the society are influencing us constantly. It is a commonplace that social behavior takes place in a network of social rules and they are constraints on behavior. </p>
    <p id="comfort">I chose one aspect of these constraints, appearance, to extend my work. No matter in what culture or country, people would have some public awareness on beauty and what a beautiful woman should look like. And even people do not care about these rules, they would still feel them because they are changing people around you. Comments and words would give labels on people and judge them, forcing them to change their faces, makeup and clothes to what most of the people like. I want to use my project to show the influence and constraints on people’s appearance,  how their faces, makeups, clothes and styles of clothes change and tend to be similar with others. And I hope people could feel better when they face others’ judgement and know that it is their own feelings that really counts. </p>
